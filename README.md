TODO: Clean up this README.

## Installation

TODO. Probably publish on `crates.io`. And create a Dockerfile.

## Usage

- Run `saffron user create <username>` to add a user.
- Run `saffron start` to start the webserver.

To view the options in the CLI, use the `help` commands.

```
saffron
A little private file hosting service

USAGE:
    saffron <SUBCOMMAND>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

SUBCOMMANDS:
    help     Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
    start    Start the webserver
    user     Users and token management
```

### Uploading

With cURL:

```sh
$ curl -v -X POST -H "Content-Type:multipart/form-data" -H"Authorization:Token <token>" -F "upload=@<filepath>" https://image.host/upload
```

## Development

Database stuff requires `sqlx-cli`:

```sh
$ cargo install --version=0.2.0 sqlx-cli --no-default-features --features sqlite
```

CSS stuff requires `yarn` to build TailwindCSS. See `package.json` for the
developer commands.

#### TODO

- File upload route using Token header.
- Get error pages working (incl. on static routes...).
- Publish to crates.io.
- Gallery frontend view!
- Image thumbnailing for gallery.
- Create a Dockerfile.
- File deletion.

- CSRF protection? If the frontend ever has more endpoints than just
  login/logout, probably worth implementing.

wrt. crates.io, we'll need a way to include the built CSS, but I don't want to
check it into VCS because dev-version CSS would override it. Perhaps a CI to
ensure that CSS is prod CSS?
